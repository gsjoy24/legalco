						As we won't be meeting in person, it's crucial to outline the agreement terms beforehand. If you have any
						questions about LegalCO, please feel free to reach out.Within this agreement, we've referred to our service
						as the 'service,' you as the 'user,'and this agreement as the 'agreement.'
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						If you plan to use our 'Common Needs' feature, you confirm that you're over 18 years old, fully capable of
						abiding by the terms, obligations, and warranties related to document creation, and are well-informed about
						these. Don't hesitate to call us for further assistance.
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">2. LEGALCO ONLY PROVIDES A MEDIUM FOR INTERACTION</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						LegalCO serves as an online platform and mobile application designed to facilitate communication,
						connections, and online consultations (via video, audio, and text) between legal professionals and potential
						users seeking legal services. It acts as a medium for information exchange, with the ultimate aim of
						establishing professional relationships. However, it's important to note that LegalCO does not guarantee the
						successful matching of users with lawyers, and it does not take a stance on whether a lawyer-client
						relationship is formed.
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						It's worth emphasizing that LegalCO operates as a bridge for interaction and does not accept responsibility
						for any losses experienced by users. Users are encouraged to take action against any individuals they
						believe have caused harm, rather than directing complaints or blame towards LegalCO. Additionally, the
						platform is not liable for services provided outside its framework.
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						LegalCO does not directly offer services to customers; any services provided by individuals are their own
						responsibility. Thus, LegalCO disclaims liability for any incorrect information, anti-government activities,
						inappropriate language, exchanged documents, or misuse that might occur. It functions solely as an online
						platform and holds no liability in these matters
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						If you join LegalCO as a lawyer or user, you are told that LegalCO only provides a medium for interaction.
						Therefore, Legalco will not be liable for any financial loss, fraud, fraud or any type of crime on the part
						of both the lawyer and the service recipient. You agree to all terms and conditions by installing the
						App/web or taking the Service from legalco.Legalco reserves the right to change prices and rules, policies
						and to remove or ban any user or any lawyer from the platform.
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">Clarification Regarding Lawyer-Client Relationship.</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						LegalCO operates as a platform that enables communication between lawyers and potential clients; however, it
						does not function as an agent for lawyers. Sending electronic communications solely to LegalCO does not
						establish a lawyer-client relationship between the user and LegalCO, as this is explicitly disclaimed.
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">LegalCO does not endorse any specific users.</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						Its purpose is to assist individuals in need of legal representation in finding lawyers who are most
						suitable for their specific requirements. LegalCO's intention is not to serve as a platform for advertising
						or solicitation, and the content provided on the app/website should not be interpreted as legal
						advice.LegalCO may suggest subscribing lawyers only if they align with a user's needs, and not otherwise.
						The use of LegalCO, whether through transmission or receipt, does not establish a lawyer-client
						relationship. Individuals who receive content from this app/website should not make decisions to act or
						refrain from acting solely based on its contents. We encourage users to independently review lawyers'
						profiles and make well-informed choices.
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">In particular, LegalCO does not facilitate any form of solicitatio</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						The platform ensures that client information remains concealed from lawyers until direct communication
						occurs between the client and lawyers, either through direct contact or online interaction. Consequently,
						lawyers are not permitted to access private details about potential clients.
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">LegalCo does not offer legal advice.</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						The 'Common Needs' feature of LegalCo uses only user-provided content to generate basic documents. The
						information in the 'FAQs' section is not considered legal advice; it simply addresses commonly asked
						questions about creating wills, drafting lease agreements, issuing cheque dishonor notices, sending money
						recovery notices, granting power of attorney for rent collection, and other potential document types that
						may be included over time. Users are recommended to seek guidance from legal professionals for specialized
						assistance with any of these documents.
					</p>
					<p className="text-justify">Restrictions on 'Common Needs' Feature Usage:</p>
					<p className="text-justify">
						LegalCO provides you with a limited, personal, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to utilize our
						'Common Needs' feature strictly for your own personal use. If you are an attorney or professional, you may
						also use it for your clients. Except as explicitly permitted, you acknowledge and agree that you are not
						authorized to modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works, reverse engineer, alter, enhance, or
						exploit the Forms in any way. However, you can make necessary modifications for completing the Forms within
						the scope of your authorized use. Terms for Purchased Documents: When you acquire a document from LegalCO,
						you are agreeing that the document is meant for your personal or business use, or for use in conjunction
